## Running [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c) Examples

Here, we provide two examples of how to run [llama2.c](https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c) written in Rust using a Candle-compiled WASM binary and runtimes.

### Pure Rust UI

To build and test the UI made in Rust you will need [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#install)
From the `candle-wasm-examples/llama2-c` directory run:

Download assets:

```bash
# Model and tokenizer

wget -c https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2/resolve/main/model.bin
wget -c https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmz/candle-llama2/resolve/main/tokenizer.json

```

Run hot reload server:

```bash
trunk serve --release --public-url / --port 9999
```

### Vanilla JS and WebWorkers

To build and test the UI made in Vanilla JS and WebWorkers, first we need to build the WASM library:

```bash
sh build-lib.sh
```

This will bundle the library under `./build` and we can import it inside our WebWorker like a normal JS module:

```js
import init, { Model } from "./build/m.js";
```

The full example can be found under `./lib-example.html`. All needed assets are fetched from the web, so no need to download anything.
Finally, you can preview the example by running a local HTTP server. For example:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000/lib-example.html` in your browser.
